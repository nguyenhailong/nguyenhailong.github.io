Today, I visit my LinkedIn and would like to retrieve my posts, which I shared in the past. Unfortunately, LinkedIn only maintainces my posts in the last two weeks. It is really disappointed. Hence, I would like to mantaince my reading list for data science by myself.

The readling list will be sorted into following categories:

1. Data Science News

2. Data Science Background

3. Data Manupulating

4. Data Visualization

5. Feature Engineering

6. Data Modelling

7. Kaggle

8. Interview Questions
