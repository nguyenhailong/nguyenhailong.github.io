* I am  currently a data scientist at [McLaren Applied Technologies Ltd](http://www.mclaren.com). Previously, I worked at Institute for Infocomm Research ([I2R](http://www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg)), A*Star, Singapore. I also got more than 2-year experience as computer engineer before earned my Ph.D. from Nanyang Technological University ([NTU](www.ntu.edu.sg)), Singapore in 2012. 

* I have strong interests in how to apply data mining/machine learning into real industries with big data. I have successfully worked and managed several industrial projects with funding up to millions dollars for big companies. These companies are McLaren, a Singapore Telco company, SoftBank - a Japanese Fortune-500 Telco company, and Singapore Energy Market Authority (EMA).
